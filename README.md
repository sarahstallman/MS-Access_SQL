# MS-Access_SQL

During my internship at RMC Group, we encountered a significant challenge in compiling financial data across the company's six different subcompanies, namely, Endeavour, P&C, FAC, Plangen, Consultants, and CJA, which fell under the purview of four distinct divisions: Pensions and Life, General Lines, Captive, and Health. The process initially involved our Business Analyst and Staff Accountant spending three days in Excel manually aggregating data from multiple sources. Unfortunately, Excel proved inadequate for this task as the data was never consistently formatted each quarter, rendering Excel formulas ineffective.
To address this issue, my colleague and I embarked on the task of finding a more efficient solution. After careful consideration, we decided to leverage Microsoft Access, primarily for its capability to utilize SQL queries to streamline the data into a comprehensive report with the desired format and accurate information. However, neither of us had prior experience with Access, necessitating a steep learning curve. The resulting repository contains individual SQL query files, each representing a unique step in this transformative process.
One of our primary challenges was reconciling account names from profit and loss statements across various companies with those used in the divisional report rollup. We tackled this issue by creating a master list that matched each account name from the profit and loss statements to their corresponding account names in the divisional rollup. Subsequently, we utilized queries to create new tables that harmonized this data.
Another issue we confronted was the presence of account names in the divisional rollups that contained data derived from the summation of two distinct pieces of information from the profit and loss statements. To resolve this, we employed queries to identify account names in the profit and loss statements that mapped to the same account name in the divisional rollups.
Moreover, one division necessitated the integration of data from two different columns of the profit and loss statement into a single column for the divisional rollup. Following meticulous adjustments, we employed a union of queries for each individual division to combine the tables from each company within the divisional rollups.
This project required a comprehensive understanding of SQL and Access, and our efforts ultimately resulted in a streamlined, automated process that significantly expedited the quarterly financial review process, saving the company valuable time and resources while ensuring the accuracy of its financial data.
Now, all that is required is to execute the macro, which runs each query in a predefined sequence for the four divisions. This streamlined process can be completed in less than an hour, marking a substantial reduction in time and effort compared to the previous manual compilation, while ensuring data accuracy and consistency.
